## Customized DigiKeyboard.h 
> To be placed under `%userdata%\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\digistump\hardware\avr\1.6.7\libraries\DigisparkKeyboard`
   
### What's Different ?    
• DigiKeyboard is declared as Keyboard for quicker scripting.    
• Tab, Delete, Arrow Keys Added.      
   
### Notes,    
- The DigiSpark has minimal memory, and therefore the best way to fit a payload is by retrieving it from the internet during the attack, this requires the victim pc to have internet access for powershell.    
- This implementation shows a classic Task Manager UAC Bypass to gain administrator privileges in powershell.    
- More keys can be added, for reference I'm adding chapter 10 of the USB HID Usage Tables, for easy addition of keys you need.
   

Installation is straight forward,
